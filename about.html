    <h1>Born from Fire, Brewed with Heart</h1>
    <p>Our story begins in a quiet Hong Kong back alley, where an ex-accountant would rise before dawn to roast beans by hand over a vintage cast-iron drum. What began as a passion project became a lifelong commitment to 匠人精神—the spirit of craftsmanship.</p>

    <p>He believed that every cup of coffee should tell a story—not of machines or shortcuts, but of hands, care, and tradition. With years of self-training, countless burned batches, and relentless pursuit of perfection, he discovered the art of roasting Geisha beans to highlight their elegant floral and tea-like notes. These aren’t just beans; they are his quiet rebellion against mass production.</p>

    <p>Today, we honour that dedication. Every bag of our coffee is roasted in small batches, by real people with real passion. Whether you savour our 150g whole bean pack or enjoy the convenience of our drip bag, you’re tasting a legacy of perseverance, humility, and love for the craft.</p>

    <p>We don’t chase trends. We honour tradition. That’s the Hand Roasted promise.</p>
